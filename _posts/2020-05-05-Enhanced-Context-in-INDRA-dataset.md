title:  Enhanced Context for Protein Interaction Dataset
subtitle: Document linking and Sentence-based Concept Wordclouds added to Harvard PPI 
---
We have enhanced the information associated with visualization for the INDRA protein interaction dataset. Now there are
direct links to the documents associated with relations, as well as new wordclouds for related concepts in the sentence from which the protein-protein relation was identified. These can be found in the new 
[Harvard SemViz dashboard](http://morbius.cs-i.brandeis.edu:23762/goto/7ae32959c9cfbc0c1ef2d4dffcf0f82b).


Also, the LAPPS Grid [Covid-QA System](http://services.lappsgrid.org/eager/ask) has just been updated to include access to 68,850 documents from the May 1, 2020 CORD-19 dataset.
