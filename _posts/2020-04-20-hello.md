 We have been developing semantic analysis tools for  identifying and interpreting information from natural language text. Recently, we have applied these semantic data models for data visualization of complex networks of relations. We believe such methods might be useful for knowledge discovery and novel inferencing and generalization  in the current drive to understand the underlying cause and spread of Covid-19. 
 
We present our initial analysis of two datasets: Blender's Cord-19 dataset analysis; and Harvard INDRA's Protein-protein-causal-analysis dataset.  We also present our LAPPS Grid Covid-QA natural language query system, Askme.

We will be updating with the analysis of new datasets from the Covid-19 research community, as well as improvements and fixes to our current systems. 

We truly hope this will be of use to the scientific community in this troubling time.
