We are developing semantic visualization techniques in order to enhance  exploration and enable discovery over large datasets of complex networks of relations. <i>Semantic visualization</i> refers to the process of (i) indexing all terms and NLP-extracted named entities, relations, and knowledge graphs from the original data source; (ii) creating semantic Wordclouds and heatmaps for  all relevant entities and relations; (iii) applying <i>parameter reduction</i> operations to relations, resulting in <i>relation containers</i> that are functional entities that visualize as wordclouds; embedding relation containers as parameters in heatmaps, in order to visualize multiple relations and partial pathways of relations  within a single heatmap display. 

We have applied this to analysis of the recently released [Covid-19 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge). We have also developed an NLP Question Answering system called the [Covid-QA System](http://services.lappsgrid.org/eager/ask), based on our [Language Application Grid](https://galaxy.lappsgrid.org/) platform within the [Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org/) environment.

  * This demonstrates several visualizations  over data derived from Harvard's [INDRA lab](https://indralab.github.io/)  readers. The source includes around 9,000 of the 52,000 articles in the Covid-19 dataset. 

* [LAPPSGrid](http://www.lappsgrid.org/) [Covid-QA System](http://services.lappsgrid.org/eager/ask)
  * The Language Applications (LAPPS) Grid AskMe document retrieval service provides sophisticated, customizable search capabilities over 14,000 full text articles related to COVID-19 research. The COVID data currently include all articles from the [CORD-19 dataset](https://pages.semanticscholar.org/coronavirus-research), eliminating duplicates, empty article files, etc. Searches over PubMed, PMC, bioRxiv and medRxiv will be available soon. Updates will be done weekly or when new data warrants.
