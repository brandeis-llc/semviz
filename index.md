We are developing semantic visualization techniques in order to enhance  exploration and enable discovery over large datasets of complex networks of relations.  We have applied this to analysis of the recently released [Covid-19 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge). We have also developed an NLP Question Answering system called the [Covid-QA System](http://services.lappsgrid.org/eager/ask), based on our [Language Application Grid](https://galaxy.lappsgrid.org/) platform within the [Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org/) environment.

  * This demonstrates several visualizations  over data derived from Harvard's [INDRA lab](https://indralab.github.io/)  readers. The source includes around 9,000 of the 52,000 articles in the Covid-19 dataset.

  * The Language Applications (LAPPS) Grid AskMe document retrieval service provides sophisticated, customizable search capabilities over 14,000+ full text articles related to COVID-19 research. The COVID data currently include all articles from the CORD-19 dataset (https://pages.semanticscholar.org/coronavirus-research), eliminating duplicates, empty article files, etc. Searches over PubMed, PMC, bioRxiv and medRxiv will be available soon. Updates will be done weekly or when new data warrants.
